# Description

## A simple mod that gives a welcoming change to the start menu of Valheim. A "Change Of Scenery" if you will. Configure the song playing, camera locations, or leave it alone and enjoy my settings.

`This mod is not needed on a server. It's client only. Install on each client that you wish to have the mod load.`

`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
